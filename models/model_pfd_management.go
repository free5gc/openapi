// Represents a PFD management resource for a PFD management request.
type PfdManagement struct {
	// string formatted according to IETF RFC 3986 identifying a referenced resource.
	Self string `json:"self,omitempty" yaml:"self" bson:"self,omitempty"`
	// A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause  6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in  hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\",  \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in  table 5.2.2-3. The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall  appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last  in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined  separately for each API. If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are  defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not  present in the string are not supported. 
	SupportedFeatures string `json:"supportedFeatures,omitempty" yaml:"supportedFeatures" bson:"supportedFeatures,omitempty"`
	// Each element uniquely identifies the PFDs for an external application identifier. Each element is identified in the map via an external application identifier as key. The response shall include successfully provisioned PFD data of application(s).
	PfdDatas map[string]PfdData `json:"pfdDatas,omitempty" yaml:"pfdDatas" bson:"pfdDatas,omitempty"`
	// Supplied by the SCEF and contains the external application identifiers for which PFD(s) are not added or modified successfully. The failure reason is also included. Each element provides the related information for one or more external application identifier(s) and is identified in the map via the failure identifier as key.
	PfdReports map[string]PfdReport `json:"pfdReports,omitempty" yaml:"pfdReports" bson:"pfdReports,omitempty"`
	// string formatted according to IETF RFC 3986 identifying a referenced resource.
	NotificationDestination string `json:"notificationDestination,omitempty" yaml:"notificationDestination" bson:"notificationDestination,omitempty"`
	// Set to true by the SCS/AS to request the SCEF to send a test notification as defined in clause 5.2.5.3. Set to false or omitted otherwise.
