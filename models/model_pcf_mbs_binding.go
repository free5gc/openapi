	// NF Set Identifier (see clause 28.12 of 3GPP TS 23.003), formatted as the following string \"set<Set ID>.<nftype>set.5gc.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>\", or  \"set<SetID>.<NFType>set.5gc.nid<NID>.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>\" with  <MCC> encoded as defined in clause 5.4.2 (\"Mcc\" data type definition)  <MNC> encoding the Mobile Network Code part of the PLMN, comprising 3 digits.    If there are only 2 significant digits in the MNC, one \"0\" digit shall be inserted    at the left side to fill the 3 digits coding of MNC.  Pattern: '^[0-9]{3}$' <NFType> encoded as a value defined in Table 6.1.6.3.3-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510 but    with lower case characters <Set ID> encoded as a string of characters consisting of    alphabetic characters (A-Z and a-z), digits (0-9) and/or the hyphen (-) and that    shall end with either an alphabetic character or a digit.

	// A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause  6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in  hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\",  \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in  table 5.2.2-3. The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall  appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last  in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined  separately for each API. If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are  defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not  present in the string are not supported.
