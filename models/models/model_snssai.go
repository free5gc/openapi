// When Snssai needs to be converted to string (e.g. when used in maps as key), the string shall be composed of one to three digits \"sst\" optionally followed by \"-\" and 6 hexadecimal digits \"sd\".
type Snssai struct {
	// Unsigned integer, within the range 0 to 255, representing the Slice/Service Type.  It indicates the expected Network Slice behaviour in terms of features and services. Values 0 to 127 correspond to the standardized SST range. Values 128 to 255 correspond  to the Operator-specific range. See clause 28.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003. Standardized values are defined in clause 5.15.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501.
	Sst int32 `json:"sst" yaml:"sst" bson:"sst,omitempty"`
	// 3-octet string, representing the Slice Differentiator, in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits of the SD shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the SD shall appear last in the string. This is an optional parameter that complements the Slice/Service type(s) to allow to  differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices of the same Slice/Service type. This IE shall be absent if no SD value is associated with the SST.
	Sd string `json:"sd,omitempty" yaml:"sd" bson:"sd,omitempty"`
}
