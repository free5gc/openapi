// One of the six attributes n3IwfId, gNbIdm, ngeNbId, wagfId, tngfId, eNbId shall be present.
type GlobalRanNodeId struct {
	PlmnId *PlmnId `json:"plmnId" yaml:"plmnId" bson:"plmnId,omitempty"`
	// This represents the identifier of the N3IWF ID as specified in clause 9.3.1.57 of  3GPP TS 38.413 in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value  of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant  character representing the 4 most significant bits of the N3IWF ID shall appear first in the  string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the N3IWF ID shall  appear last in the string.
	N3IwfId string `json:"n3IwfId,omitempty" yaml:"n3IwfId" bson:"n3IwfId,omitempty"`
	GNbId   *GNbId `json:"gNbId,omitempty" yaml:"gNbId" bson:"gNbId,omitempty"`
	// This represents the identifier of the ng-eNB ID as specified in clause 9.3.1.8 of  3GPP TS 38.413. The value of the ng-eNB ID shall be encoded in hexadecimal representation.  Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and  shall represent 4 bits. The padding 0 shall be added to make multiple nibbles, so the most  significant character representing the padding 0 if required together with the 4 most  significant bits of the ng-eNB ID shall appear first in the string, and the character  representing the 4 least significant bit of the ng-eNB ID (to form a nibble) shall appear last  in the string.
	NgeNbId string `json:"ngeNbId,omitempty" yaml:"ngeNbId" bson:"ngeNbId,omitempty"`
	// This represents the identifier of the W-AGF ID as specified in clause 9.3.1.162 of  3GPP TS 38.413 in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value  of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant  character representing the 4 most significant bits of the W-AGF ID shall appear first in the  string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the W-AGF ID shall  appear last in the string.
	WagfId string `json:"wagfId,omitempty" yaml:"wagfId" bson:"wagfId,omitempty"`
	// This represents the identifier of the TNGF ID as specified in clause 9.3.1.161 of  3GPP TS 38.413  in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\"  to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the  4 most significant bits of the TNGF ID shall appear first in the string, and the character  representing the 4 least significant bit of the TNGF ID shall appear last in the string.
	TngfId string `json:"tngfId,omitempty" yaml:"tngfId" bson:"tngfId,omitempty"`
	// This represents the Network Identifier, which together with a PLMN ID is used to identify an SNPN (see 3GPP TS 23.003 and 3GPP TS 23.501 clause 5.30.2.1).
	Nid string `json:"nid,omitempty" yaml:"nid" bson:"nid,omitempty"`
	// This represents the identifier of the eNB ID as specified in clause 9.2.1.37 of  3GPP TS 36.413. The string shall be formatted with the following pattern  '^('MacroeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{5}|LMacroeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|SMacroeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{5} |HomeeNB-[A-Fa-f0-9]{7})$'. The value of the eNB ID shall be encoded in hexadecimal representation. Each character in the  string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits.  The padding 0 shall be added to make multiple nibbles, so the most significant character  representing the padding 0 if required together with the 4 most significant bits of the eNB ID  shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit  of the eNB ID (to form a nibble) shall appear last in the string.
	ENbId string `json:"eNbId,omitempty" yaml:"eNbId" bson:"eNbId,omitempty"`
